# SSH Dynamic Port Forwarding (SOCKS)

You need to test a web app from home, and you need to tunnel all of your traffic through a Kali VM 
running in Amazon EC2.

ssh -i amazon.pem ec2-user@kali
sudo -i
vim /etc/proxychains.conf
Add a new last line: socks5 127.0.0.1 1080
exit
exit

ssh -D 1080 -f -N -i amazon.pem ec2-user@kali1

Open Burp locally.
Project options > Connections > SOCKS Proxy
Check Override user options
SOCKS Proxy host: 127.0.0.1
SOCKS Proxy port: 1080
Check Use SOCKS proxy
Check Do DNS lookups over SOCKS proxy

Open Firefox to http://whatismyipaddress.com
The IP address should be that of your Kali EC2.

# Methodology

# Scope
Firefox > surf to the target site and click on a couple of links.
Burp > Target > Site map > right click (RC) on the target URL > Add to scope
Target > Scope: you will see the URL listed in the top window
Target > Site map > Filter: enable Show only in-scope items > Filter

# Manually browse the app
Look for target.com/sitemap.
If present, hold down the command key and click on every link.
If not present, start exploring the target by clicking on every link on every page.
Continue until you have thoroughly browsed the target.

# Spider the app
Target > Site map > RC on the target URL > Spider this host
Spider > Control: watch the Requests made increase.
When the Requests and Forms queued are both zero, click Spider is running to stop.

Target > Site map > RC the target URL > Expand branch
Scroll to the very bottom.
RC on any folders that are greyed out > Delete branch
RC on any pages that are grey or red > Copy URL > paste into Firefox
     Or RC on any pages that are grey or red > GET Empty Response

# Brute force directories
Target > Site map > RC on the second line '/' > Send to Intruder
Intruder > Position > Attack type: Sniper
Clear §
On the top line, select the forward slash '/' after GET > Add §
Move the forward slash in front of the two symbols. It should look like: GET /§§

Payloads:
     Payload Sets
          Payload set: 1
          Payload type: Runtime file
     Payload Options:
          Select file > seclists > Discovery > Web_Content > raft-medium-directories.txt > Open
     Start attack

Clean up results when the attack completes:
     Filter > uncheck 4xx [request error] > Filter
     Click Status to sort by ascending.
     Select the first line with a 302 Status.
     Hold down shift and select the last line with a 302 Status.
     RC > Delete select items > Yes

Add remaining items to Site map:
     Scroll to the top of the list > sort by Payload
     Delete any blanks lines
     Move the Intruder window to the side so you can see the main window
     Target > Site map 
     Compare the pages in the Site map to the Payloads in the Intruder window.
     Select a Payload that is not listed in the Site map
     RC > Request in browser > In current session
     Check: In future, just copy the URL and don't show this dialog > Copy
     Open a new tab in Firefox and paste.
     Repeat as necessary.

Target > Site map > RC the target URL > Engagement tools > Analyze target
Take a screenshot of the Summary tab.
These numbers will give you an idea of how large the app is.

# Grey folders
RC on grey folder > GET Empty Response
If the folder is still grey > RC > Delete branch > Yes

# Review comments
Target > Site map > RC the target URL > Engagement tools > Find comments
Sort by Item
Select each line > Response > look for sensitive information.
Use the search field at the bottom to search for href.
Copy/paste new URL into browser.

Engagement tools > Search: set-cookie
---------------------------------------------------------------

# Check for 404 and 500 errors
Enter a single tick (') at the end of a URL.
Modify the URL path.
Enter a single tick (') in any input field and submit the form.
---------------------------------------------------------------

# Brute force logins
Try to login
Proxy > History > find the POST request > RC > Send to Intruder

Intruder > Payloads > Attack type:
     Sniper:
          Uses a single wordlist against a single variable.
     Battering ram:
          Uses a single wordlist against all variables.
     Pitchfork:
          Uses multiple wordlists.
          For example: you have a known list of usernames and a related list of passwords. 
          This will try the first username with the first password, then the second username with the second password, and so on.
          This is useful when checking for old accounts that should be deleted.
     Cluster bomb:
          Uses multiple wordlists.
          For example: you have a known list of usernames and a non-related list of passwords.
          This will try the first username with each password, then the second username with each password, and so on.

-- Brute force basic authentication: Sniper
     Clear $
     Highlight the Authorization: Basic parameter > Add $
     This parameter is Base64 encoded.
     Copy the parameter > Decoder > paste in the top window
     Select the top drop-down menu on the right > Base64
     For example: YWRtaW46dGVzdDEyMw== decoded is admin:test123
     Notice there is a colon between the username and password
     
     Intruder > Payloads > Payload Sets > Payload type: Custom iterator
     List 1 with the possible Usernames and List 2 with possible passwords.
     Position: 1
          Type in the username (admin in our example) > Add
          Separator for position 1: : (colon in our example)
     Position: 2
          Load > choose your wordlist > Open
     Now we need to encode the whole string into Base64.
     <*** more stuff here ***>
     Start attack
     
-- Brute force a password: Sniper
     Clear $
     Highlight the password you entered > Add $
     Intruder > Payloads > Payload Options
     Load > choose your password list > Open
     Start attack

-- Brute force usernames and passwords: Cluster bomb
     Clear $
     Highlight the username you entered > Add $ 
     Highlight the password you entered > Add $
     Intruder > Payloads
          Payload Sets
               Payload set: 1
               Payload type: Simple list
          Payload Options
               Clear > Load: choose your username list > Open
          Payload Sets
               Payload set: 2
               Payload type: Simple list
          Payload Options
               Clear > Load: choose your password list > Open
          Start attack

Filter > uncheck 4xx [request error] > Filter
Click Status to sort by ascending.
Look for a 302 (redirect). This should be a successful login.

# CSRF

You should be logged into the web application.
Create a list of all POST requests that do not have a unique token called ‘CSRF_Token’. 

Proxy > HTTP history > Filter > Filter by search term
     ^POST((?!CSRF_Token).)*$
     Click Regex

RC on the first request > Engagement tools > Generate CSRF PoC
Test in browser > Copy
Open a new tab in Firefox > paste

Look for evidence that it executed whatever that HTTP request was supposed to do.

# Manually Validate Findings

File path traversal: RC in the Request body > Send to Repeater > modify the request 
XML Injection: Search in the Response body for http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema. This is a false positive.
XSS: RC in the Request body > Request in browser > In current browser session
